# A way to calculate how much time Kurapika from Hunter x Hunter will lose each time he uses the Emperor Time ability.

# When Kurapika's eyes shift into scarlet, he changes from a Conjurer to a Specialist. 
# This ability allows him to utilize all the types of Nen to 100% efficiency (for a Conjurer).
# Kurapika explains this using the terms "Level", "Force", and "Accuracy": his "Levels" in the various Nen categories remain the same during Emperor Time, but his "Force" and "Accuracy" for every category are raised to 100%. 
# Thus, if Kurapika's "Level" in Conjuration was 10, his "Level" in Emission (the polar opposite aura type) would remain 4 at the most, but his "Force" and "Accuracy" in any Emission ability would increase from 40% to 100%, making him evenly matched against a Level 4 Emitter.
# However, the price to pay is considerable, as every second spent in this mode shortens Kurapika's lifespan by one hour.
